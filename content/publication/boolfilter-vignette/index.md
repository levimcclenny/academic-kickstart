abstract: "The BoolFilter package provides tools for state estimation and inference of partially-observed
Boolean dynamical systems. This package contains functions for simulating data, obtaining the
optimal estimator in the presence of various observation noise models, applying the optimal
MMSE filter and smoother, particle filter implementation of optimal filter, as well as means
of parameter estimation and network inference.

BoolFilter was created explicitly to handle the latest tools developed for signal model of partially-observed Boolean dynamical system (POBDS). This signal model was introduced
to model dynamical systems containing Boolean variables observed indirectly through a noisy measurement process. This observation noise could be a result of instrumentation, incorrect thresholding, etc"
